# Data Science Fundamentals Exercises

Hello! I am a data science student at Allameh University, and this repository contains my exercises for the Data Science Fundamentals course. This course is taught by Dr. Farzad Eskandari.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the following exercises:

1. [**LinearRegressionCoefficients.ipynb**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=LinearRegressionCoefficients.ipynb): Calculation of linear regression coefficients.
2. [**Proof_of_Model_Error_Distribution_in_Binomial_Distribution.ipynb**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=Proof_of_Model_Error_Distribution_in_Binomial_Distribution.ipynb): Proof of model error distribution in binomial distribution.

## Descriptions

•  [**LinearRegressionCoefficients.ipynb**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=LinearRegressionCoefficients.ipynb): In this notebook, the coefficients of linear regression are calculated using various methods.

•  [**Proof_of_Model_Error_Distribution_in_Binomial_Distribution.ipynb**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=Proof_of_Model_Error_Distribution_in_Binomial_Distribution.ipynb): In this notebook, the error distribution of the model in a binomial distribution is proven.
